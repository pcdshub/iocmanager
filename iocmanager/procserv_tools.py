"""
The procserv_tools module defines helper functions for interfacing with procServ.

procServ (https://github.com/ralphlange/procServ) is a program that
runs other programs inside of it, making stdin/stdout/stderr available
for reading/writing via telnet connection.

It is typically used to run EPICS IOCs.

Managing these procServ processes is the key role of iocmanager.

    The payload expected from an external "verify" function in apply_config.

    This is provided to the "verify" function in apply_config.
    The "verify" function should mutate, replace, or leave these lists
    as they are, depending on which actions it needs to veto.

    The lists returned by the "verify" function are the final authority
    for which changes are allowed to be made.
    For example, you can return empty lists to veto applying any changes,
    or return the full object again to agree to all changes,

    Starts, restarts, and kills IOCs to match the saved configuration.

    If a verify function is provided, it will be called first to let the

    Note:
    - This relies on the status directory being populated
      correctly, which is handled by start_proc.
    - This may implicitly modify/clean up the status directory via
      calling read_status_dir

    Parameters
    ----------
    cfg : str
        The name of the hutch, or a full filepath to the config file.
    verify : callable, optional
        An optionally provided function that is expected to take an
        ApplyConfigContext and a VerifyPlan and return a VerifyPlan.
        You can create a new VerifyPlan or mutate the provided object.
    ioc : str, optional
        The name of a single IOC to apply to, if provided.
        If not provided, we'll apply the entire configuration.
