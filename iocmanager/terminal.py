"""
The terminal module implements functions for opening floating terminal windows.

These are useful in the GUI for e.g. helping the user telnet to a host
or tail a logfile.

Note: this file needs to be tested manually on various operating systems.

e.g.
python -m iocmanager.tests.interactive floating_terminal command
python -m iocmanager.tests.interactive gnome_terminal command
python -m iocmanager.tests.interactive xterm_terminal command

    Helper function for running a command in a compatible floating terminal.

    Depending on the OS, different terminal emulators might be installed.
    In order of priority, we'll choose:
    - xterm if it is available
    - gnome-terminal if the gnome-terminal-server is available

    In older versions of iocmanager, we used gnome-terminal for everything.
    Unfortunately, this is a poorly-behaving app:
    - On some servers it isn't installed
    - On some it is installed, but gnome-terminal-server must be run first
    - On others there is no such requirement
    - gnome-terminal-server takes something like 0.1-0.5 seconds to get ready
      and there's no way to know when it is except just trying
    - gnome-terminal-server closes itself if you don't create your gnome-terminal
      fast enough (5 secs?)
    - Sometimes, gnome-terminal-server crashes with a variety of error messages
    - gnome-terminal-server's process doesn't exit promptly after dying (3 secs?)
    - gnome-terminal's return code is ALWAYS 0 if it fails to open at all

    I gave it a good try. The code for this is still here.
    I want these windows to open promptly and reliably so we'll
    default to xterm.
